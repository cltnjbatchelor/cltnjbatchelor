            Hello Everyone my name is Clayton. Welcome to my blog as well as my life journal. I decided to build a website starting as a static site and add to it everyday until I make it into a full stack platform. To push my skills and as well as my web development education. I am currently 36 years old and live on my stepmoms couch. I did was a delivery driver as well as worked for uber. Although the car broke down and pretty expensive fix. So I am currently jobless

        I also dropped out of school because I was having difficulty working and going to school as well as starting a new relationship. Although I think I am starting to figure things out now on how to organize my life a bit more between those three because I need to fit more into it now. Especially while pushing out some bad habbits and trying to get a few good ones started up.

        If I could fit work and school into a schedule monday through thursday. Then I can take friday saturday and sunday for my time. I could spend it working on some project I would like to get done or go out on an adventure. Everyday I will be more focused on my education, my health and my finances. By the time I graduate I am hoping to put many of my skills to use and make myself to the best I can be.
